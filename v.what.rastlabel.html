<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.what.rastlabel</em> retrieves raster values and labels from one
or more given raster maps for each point stored in a given vector map.
The name of the columns with the raster values and labels are
respectively<i>ID_name-of-raster-map</i> and <i>name-of-raster-map</i>.

<p>Optionally, the user can define raster layers without labels. In that case
only raster values are uploaded to a column with the name
<i>name-of-raster-map</i>.

<p>Except the columns with raster values, the attribute table of the
output vector point map contains columns with coordinates [should
probably be removed in future version] and a column 'label', which
contains the cat values of input vector layer.

<p>Instead of creating a new vector layer, there is also the option to write
the raster values and lables written to the input vector layer. Note that if
there is already a column with the same name as the raster layer, the values in
that column will be overwritten without warning!
